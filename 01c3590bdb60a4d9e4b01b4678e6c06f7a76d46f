      "message": "I merged it since I think it is correct, all my tests and the Gerrit tests succeeded, and I didn\u0027t get any comments anymore.\n\nTL;DR: we\u0027re getting closer, but we\u0027re not there yet.\n\nA new release of Apache MINA sshd is still a bit away. I am a member of the Apache MINA PMC, but all release stuff for sshd is done by Guillaume, and the project doesn\u0027t really have a release plan. It\u0027s all very ad-hoc; basically a new release gets done when someone asks for it and the maintainers think there are enough fixes or new features to warrant a new release...\n\nRight now we can\u0027t release; Lyor has broken the build. (Again. :-( Don\u0027t know why he can\u0027t set up his Eclipse and maven correctly to build with Java 1.8; every so often he commits something that works only on Java 11, but the project\u0027s BREE is still Java 1.8.)\n\nApart from fixing the build, I want to get fixes in for SSHD-1266 (that PR is basically ready; fixes a minor bug of no importance to JGit or Gerrit) and SSHD-1262 (progressing well but still needs work, no PR yet; fixes a major bug caused by a fundamentally flawed implementation of TCP/IP port forwarding, probably of no importance to Gerrit unless it used port forwarding -- which I don\u0027t think it does).",
