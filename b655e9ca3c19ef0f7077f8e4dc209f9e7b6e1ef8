It doesn’t change the long-standing behavior, so it is safe from a functional standpoint. It took me three days to understand the class the first time I read it.\n\nSince then I have renamed the class file and my name is on the blame [1], so I hope to leave it a bit easier to understand.\n\nLet me know your thoughts, thank you!\n\n[1] https://git.eclipse.org/r/plugins/gitiles/jgit/jgit/+blame/refs/heads/master/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/internal/storage/file/PackReverseIndexComputed.java",
