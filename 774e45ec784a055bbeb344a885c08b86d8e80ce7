      "message": "The double-read removal is too dangerous IMHO, please review the command and provide performance data with the two reads compared to the stable-6.10 version.\n\nAlso, I\u0027ve summarised the status of the issue jgit-152 to have a wider discussion also on other options.\n\nLastly, I\u0027d like to see the performance impact of this change when deleting tags with a *partial concurrent pack-refs* of some refs not involved in the delete itself and publish the results as part of the commit message.",
