      "message": "There wasn\u0027t really a way to check the length without having a known set of capabilities here. So, I\u0027ve added that set, but am not checking the length. If we receive \"cap\u003d\" we\u0027ll set an empty string as the value as it was sent.\n\nThis does raise the question of what to do when we receive `unknownCapability\u003dsome-value`. For now, I\u0027ve left this behaving like it did before. That is that we will add the entire capability to the map as a key with null for the value. I think this could changed to reject a request with an known capability. But, we might as well extend that to all capabilities at the same time, not just those with an associated value.\n\nI added to the unit test to show this behavior explicitly.",
