      "message": "No, I wasn\u0027t! Thanks. IIUC we have been working on complementary stack of changes. 1202277 is about *loading* the midx and non-dfs side, this stack is about *writing* it and some wip dfs integration.\n\nThis series should not overlap yet with the loading code. Is only about writing and debugging the output.\n\nNit: I used here storage.midx package for the common midx code (dfs or not). Probably we could move the MultiPackIndex interface and other classes here?",
