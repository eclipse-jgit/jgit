If a JGit change merging master to servlet-4 breaks the build of Gerrit master we should not submit this JGit merge until a Gerrit change fixing this problem is available.",

I believe it would make sense to do the same with Gerrit, but then we\u0027ll have to restrict the contributions to the Gerrit repository; otherwise, it would not make any difference.\n\n\u003e I think we should do the same with the JGit CI jobs and move the CI pipeline definitions to the jgit-pipelines repo (which already exists, but I didn\u0027t yet find time to move the pipeline definitions there).\n\nSure and agreed. This change though isn\u0027t really a CI for JGit, which continues to be done with the Gerrit Trigger Plugin, but rather a _safety net_ for preventing future breakages on the `servlet-4` with Gerrit.\n\nFrom that point of view, I believe this script does not belong to the JGit project, but it should be fully self-contained in the gerrit-ci-scripts project in Gerrit.",
