      "message": "This is inside `pack()`, but your code changes only affect `delete()`. Since your test case relies on running another method with a [known race condition](https://eclipse.gerrithub.io/c/eclipse-jgit/jgit/+/1176274/comment/85ae4029_0ff96036/) directly related to deleting a loose ref, I think that makes it really difficult to determine which method is producing the buggy behavior.",

      "message": "I believe they are two sides of the same issue: how do you reliably remove an element from a set whilst the set is processed?\n\nThe set is `packed-refs`, the `delete(ref)` is the removal of an element from the set and the `pack(refs)` is the processing operation.\n\nThe set is the packed-refs, the `pack(refs)` is processing and lock whilst the `delete(ref)` in JGit isn\u0027t processing the lock properly, hence it is fixed here and aligned with the C code.\n\nIn fact, when you delete a ref in C git, the packed-refs are locked upfront, but they are not in JGit.\n\n@danielesassoli@gmail.com has highlighted one of the ways of easily reproducing the issue, but of course, you can have many others.",
