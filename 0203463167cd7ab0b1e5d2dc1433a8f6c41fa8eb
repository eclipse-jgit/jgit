      "message": "This PS1 is a hack that completely removes checking the objects/pack dir timestamp or the trustFolderStat config and just always rechecks for packs when called.\n\nA non-hack solution might be to split up trustFolderStat to have distinct policies for each folder. In this case it might be `trustPackFolderStat` or since the stat we care about is modification, maybe improve the naming with `trustPackDirModificationTime`.\n\nThe other current use of trustFolderStat is for the packed-refs file modification time. Arguably a new config should have been used in change I2b65cfaa8f since that\u0027s a file and not a folder. Adding that config now as `trustPackedRefsModificationTime` would make the behavior clear. We can leave `trustFolderStat` as an alias that enables both.",

The rescan only happens when there\u0027s an error or a \"miss\" condition and is likely very fast on most filesystems. For filesystems where it would be slow, they are also likely to be the ones where we can\u0027t trust the directory timestamp and we\u0027d want to rescan anyway.",
