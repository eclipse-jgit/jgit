That\u0027s useful for blame, and useful for getting a history filtered to one path.\n\nThe extension to multiple paths can be left for the future. (To become useful, a multi-path rename detection would need also updates in FollowFilter and probably EGit\u0027s RenameTracker, and possibly elsewhere. It\u0027s really a much larger endeavor.)",
