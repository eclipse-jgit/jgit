      "message": "That commit added the getCanonicalPath() but they did not put an argument why they would need exactly that system call. They only wanted \"prevent visiting the same object\" . Why did they want that? (performance? -\u003e bad job)\n\nHow could those file names inside a git could contain a symlink? \nCounterproof: if it would be needed to follow symlinks here they would have a problem, because only unix does but windows does not.\n\nHow could those file names inside a git could contain both an uppercase and a lowercase version of the same file?\nCounterproof: if a git would contain both upper and lowercase version of a filename it would would result on the same file in windows but on distinct files on linux -\u003e does not work.",
