      "message": "How about a self-tuning approach for identifying frequently used refs instead of manual configuration ? I guess that branches which are updated frequently also tend to be fetched more frequently. We could use reflogs to identify refs which weren\u0027t updated since a configurable time and exclude them from bitmap index.\nGC is already accessing the reflogs so I think the overhead would be limited.",
