      "message": "We are doing this to fit \"cache over multiple tables\", so it should be explained here. Also, IIUC, this is just a refactor to accommodate later the List\u003cstats\u003e API, right?\n\nUse the first paragraph for the problem. e.g.\n\nThe DfsBlockCache can use internally more than one table, but the stats API assumes only one. This has worked so far because we return the aggregated stats of all tables, but to fine-tune the cache, we need also the stats of each table.\n\nAnd the second/third paragraphs explains your solution, e.g.\n\nRefactor the code, so instead of an implementation of stats for one table and implementation for n tables, we have just the implementation (for a single table) and an aggregator class.\n\nLater we can make the cache return a list stats and let the caller aggregate if needed.",

      "message": "\u003e We are doing this to fit \"cache over multiple tables\", so it should be explained here\n\nThis isn\u0027t really adding any new functionality (other than changing AggregatedBlockCacheStats from private in PackExt). So \"what we are doing\" is what we were already doing.\n\n\u003e Also, IIUC, this is just a refactor to accommodate later the List\u003cstats\u003e API, right?\n\nThat\u0027s the reason why this change started, but imo this structure makes more sense than the non-uniform use of inner classes (some were done in the block cache interface class, some in a cache implmenetation). Both implementations that were moved to their own files are generic enough to not be specific to any one implementation (hence the name change to AggregatedBlockCacheStats).\n\nI considered moving AggregatedBlockCacheStats to where DfsBlockCacheStats was defined, but instead chose to move the implemenations to their own files producing this change that\u0027s effectively a move.\n\n\u003e (...)\n\nThe rest of this comment will be considered, but I wanted to hear your thoughts from these replies first.",
