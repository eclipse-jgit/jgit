FirstWant parses that line but doesn\u0027t understand the newish session-id capability.\n\nSecond paragraph: Teach FirstWant to parse the session-id capability\n\nThird paragraph: This is necessary to support session-id in UploadPack (so far it is implemented only in ReceivePack).",

You mean that the session-id is optional, the client CAN send it if the server send the session-id capability before.\n\nYou can mention also that at the moment the capability is not advertised by default because the handling is not fully implemented.",
