However, the tests was not checking the annotated tags and, once I\u0027ve added them, the test failed.\n\nI agree with you that it seems unrelated though. I\u0027ll take the action to write one specific test on this error use-case, with a more representative name.\n\nP.S. Thanks a lot for the review and feedback, much appreciated.",
