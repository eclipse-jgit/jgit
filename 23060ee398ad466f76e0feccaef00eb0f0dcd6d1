      "message": "It expects line A pre image and it\u0027s not there which is why it\u0027s a conflict in the first place. If it was there, the logic would have deleted it, so it\u0027s gone post image. The patch file does tell what it expects post image to look like:\n\n```\n line3\n lineB\n line5\n line6\n```\n\nSo no line A.\n\nThis is exactly what the conflict markers say? (the part between \u003c\u003c and \u003d\u003d has pre image and the part between \u003d\u003d and \u003e\u003e has post image and we can\u0027t automatically merge these two, so spit out conflict markers).\n\nHow could we do a 3way merge if we can\u0027t find the patch sha1 in the repo? (i.e. how would we construct the base/other/mine file from the patch and repo and what would that help with?)",

      "message": "\u003e So no line A.\nI understand the logic of why this is currently not shown here. But if the users are looking only at the result file, they see the patch they actually expected to apply as the *post image*, with no conflict visible to them; then they should go to the *patch input* (which is stored elsewhere) and manually compare it with the *pre image* to see that there\u0027s a mishmash. This is quite tedious IMO.\n\n\u003e How could we do a 3way merge\nWe can\u0027t do the actual merge this way, but I think we can (and should) construct the diff markers in a similar way. Can\u0027t the missing part be directly inferred from the `hunkLines` variable?",

Also, in the case of a conflict, the location of the marker is likely wrong, so putting the conflict marker in-line will confuse users, and once they figure it out, they\u0027ll send bug reports about it to us.\n\nExpanding the diff as in Nitzan\u0027s example makes the (confusing) conflict markers even more unwieldy, because there are now 3 sections instead of 2, but I think it\u0027s good to somehow expose the \u0027before\u0027 lines, so users can see where the patch should have been applied.\n\nHere is my suggestion: have applyText() return a separate list of failed patch hunks. \n\nThis could be used for generating a .rej file later on (for compatibility with git-apply --reject), but as a first approach, simply append the rejected hunks to the file.",
