Common sense tells me that .keep is like a child file (if no pack, the .keep seems useless) but existing code and tests treat it as a parent.\n\nIn this case I agree with respecting existing behavior (.keep as parent file). In the worst case we just delete less than we should (better than erring in the other direction).\n\nUsually I would leave this unresolved so Minh can ACK this solution, but as we are choosing the \"safe\" option, I\u0027ll submit as it is. We can always update the logic in a follow-up change.",
