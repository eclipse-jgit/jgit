Do you get any halfway meaningful error message in EGit?\n\n(I can\u0027t test myself unfortunately. Had problems with the target platform, and now my Eclipse refuses to laucnh a child Eclipse with a SIGSEGV. Bah. It\u0027ll cost me hours to get a working development environment again.)",

      "message": "This is dealt with in `org.eclipse.jgit.internal.transport.sshd.agent.SshAgentClient` in method `sign(...)`. In that case the response would not be `SSH2_AGENT_SIGN_RESPONSE` but rather `SSH_AGENT_FAILURE` which would trigger an exception (compare with https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-miller-ssh-agent#name-private-key-operations). However this is outside of the scope of this request if it needs to be improved as this edge case may already happen today (i.e. a public key is identified for which the agent does not find a suitable private key)",
