      "message": "Looks OK, just one worry: what happens if you specify\n```\n  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/some_key.pub\n  IdentitiesOnly\n```\nand the corresponding key is _not_ in the agent? Do you get any halfway meaningful error message in EGit?\n\n(I can\u0027t test myself unfortunately. Had problems with the target platform, and now my Eclipse refuses to laucnh a child Eclipse with a SIGSEGV. Bah. It\u0027ll cost me hours to get a working development environment again.)",

      "message": "This is dealt with in `org.eclipse.jgit.internal.transport.sshd.agent.SshAgentClient` in method `sign(...)`. In that case the response would not be `SSH2_AGENT_SIGN_RESPONSE` but rather `SSH_AGENT_FAILURE` which would trigger an exception (compare with https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-miller-ssh-agent#name-private-key-operations). However this is outside of the scope of this request if it needs to be improved as this edge case may already happen today (i.e. a public key is identified for which the agent does not find a suitable private key)",

      "message": "Yeah, that\u0027s not what I meant. I\u0027ve managed to get my Eclipse back into a working state, and could test myself. Behavior is unchanged.\n\nThe point is: there\u0027s no key from the agent, so later that public key file will be read as a private key, which will fail. If that\u0027s the only IdentityFile specified, the user will get a message about there not being any keys to try. (Improving that so that the user would get a message \"Cannot read private key from file XYZ\" is indeed out of scope for this change. It\u0027s also not exactly trivial to funnel that message back to the user. We do log a message, but an Eclipse user won\u0027t see that.)",
