I was changing UploadPack because I was assuming the restriction to HEAD and refs/ namespaces only applied there, but going back and reading the javadoc on RefDatabase.getRefs(), that seems to have the same contract (but unless I\u0027m missing something, the implementation doesn\u0027t match). If you agree, it might be more appropriate to move this logic into RefDatabase.",

      "message": "It could advertise refs outside of the `refs/` namespace other than `HEAD`. For example, if someone had a symref like `NOT_HEAD` on their remote, I think fetching with a refspec like `NOT*:refs/remotes/origin/*` would return it, but with git.git it wouldn\u0027t. I could try to add a test case for that.\n\nIt was also potentially wasted work for the more likely case where there was no matching ref outside of `refs`. For example, if someone ran `git fetch origin d*:refs/remotes/origin/d*`, RefDatabase would try to get all refs (since there\u0027s no \u0027/\u0027) and then filter for any starting with \u0027d\u0027. Since almost all refs are going to start with `refs/`, that won\u0027t match any. I can check the existing test cases for coverage, but I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s worth mocking the classes to test that we don\u0027t try to get all refs in this case. If it\u0027s simple to do I\u0027ll try to add it.",
