      "message": "I don\u0027t like this part of the change honestly.\n\nFrom my POV what we are trying to do to RenameDetector is not how the code was meant to be written/used.\n\nEssentially if we are applying a set of paths as a filter, we must do 2 rename detections and this class was built to be used like this:\n\nadd diffs\ndetect renames\nreset\n\nadd diffs\ndetect renames\nreset\n\nIMO we should write a wrapper for this class, something like RenameDetectorWithFilters (name TBD). This then does 2 rename detection passes, like this change currently is doing.\n\nThis would IMO lead to better looking code and no changes to RenameDetector.\n\nIf this were my code I wouldn\u0027t accept the changes in the current review, they are too invasive and I think too error prone. Its very easy to overlook where added/removed/entries are used directly in some of the methods. I did it twice in the scope of an hour...",
