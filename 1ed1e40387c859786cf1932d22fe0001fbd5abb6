      "message": "Why? If the situation of the packfiles is different on the filesystem, we must refresh the in-memory packlist.\n\nAt the moment, we have the paradox that if the situation of the packfiles changes on disk in the middle of a Git operation, half of the operation would work with a stale list of packfiles and the other half will get a refreshed list, making the operation to miserably fail.\n\nThe second attempt will then succeed because the refreshed list will help the 2nd attempt to get the whole git operation in a consistent fashion.\n\nI believe also this assertion isn\u0027t directly related to the problem that @Christian wanted to fix. The only fix was related to bitmaps, making sure that they are invalidated in memory if the index file is gone.",
