      "message": "Modifiying FileRepository directly was my first approach also. But combined with the fix  proposed in [1] I thought it best to combine both in a new class which takes care about the \"special handling\" in one common place.\n\nPossible alternative approaches(w/o introducing the new class): \na) Add a new public method \"create(boolean bare, boolean relDir)\" to FileRepository which allows the use of a relative path depending on \"relDir\". The current \"create\" method (line 225) can then be redirected to it.\nBenefit: backward compatible, the possibility to use a relative dir is independent of the submodule use case\n\nb) Add a switch to existing code in lines 296 to 304 evaluating the repository path. If the path contains \"modules\"(to identify the submodule usecase) create a relative dir otherwise a absolute one.\nBenefit: changes as less code as possible \nDrawback compared to a): relative paths work for submodulds only.\n\nImplementing either alternative approach implies a rework of [1] as the new class is mssing.\n\n\n [1] https://eclipse.gerrithub.io/c/eclipse-jgit/jgit/+/1198662/",
