      "message": "Indeed it seems that one Apache HTTP Client is currently only used for a single connection. In that case I can only imagine that the \"Connection Reset\" happens because of incorrectly set up retries (https://www.baeldung.com/java-retrying-requests-using-apache-httpclient). The default should be 3 retries for and I can hardly imagine that there are three subsequent connection resets for newly established connections.",
