The second one can succeed only if there is no other existing child of a/b such as a/b/d.\n\nAnd yes, if a/b exists as loose ref, no other x -\u003e a/b/\u003cany\u003e can succeed. (Packed refs should obey the same rules, irrespective of whether the ref exists as loose ref on disk, otherwise one may get lock conflicts later on, right?)",
