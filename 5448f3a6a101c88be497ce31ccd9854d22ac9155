      "message": "I don\u0027t know yet if this series helps at all. We see a large instantaneous spike in our http thread pool right after git gc completes in production. The spike drops right back down, but can take up to a minute. Metrics show a massive block cache eviction at this point which makes sense. I am hoping that this will reduce that spike. I do know that back in our Gerrit 2.7 days that we would every now and then see Gerrit get into a weird state where it was really slow, and I believe the jstacks would show a massive amount of removeAll()s being called over and over.",
