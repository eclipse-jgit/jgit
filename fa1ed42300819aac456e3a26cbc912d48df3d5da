      "message": "I\u0027ve noticed this problem before but saw it again this morning and thought I\u0027d try creating a patch for it. We have CI systems that create shorter-lived branches (typically now through the Gerrit batch plugin) and the refs are deleted automatically after a few days. By then they\u0027re packed and deleting them always leaves a lot of empty directories which slows down ref access overall.\n\nI haven\u0027t actually tried running this yet and I think some test coverage would be good, so that\u0027s why I have it as WIP. If anyone can take an early look and give me feedback, that\u0027d be great.",
