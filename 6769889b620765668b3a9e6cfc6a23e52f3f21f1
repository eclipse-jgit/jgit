      "message": "As far as I see C git does not have a `pre-fetch` hook.[1] The documentation of `git fetch` even says so explicitly: \"...there is no configuration whichâ€™ll amend these rules, and nothing like a pre-fetch hook...\"[2] Some old discussion about such a feature is at [3], but apparently it went nowhere.\n\nI also don\u0027t get the implementation. One can set a number of parameters, but how does the hook script get them? (`getParameters()` is not implemented.) Plus there\u0027s this private `canRun()` -- what\u0027s the point of that?\n\n[1] https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks\n[2] https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fetch\n[3] https://public-inbox.org/git/5898be69-4211-d441-494d-93477179cf0e@gaspard.io/",
