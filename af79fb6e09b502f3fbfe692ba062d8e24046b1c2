      "message": "two issues: 1) I think this needs to be a single line, 2) \"now\" is vague to a future reader. I also simplified the note text since I think anyone who wants more context can check the git log.\n```suggestion\n| `core.trustPackedRefsStat` | `unset` | \u0026#x20DE; | Whether to trust the file attributes (Java equivalent of stat command on *nix) of the packed-refs file. If `never` JGit will ignore the file attributes of the packed-refs file and always read it. If `always` JGit will trust the file attributes of the packed-refs file and will only read it if a file attribute has changed. `after_open` behaves the same as `always`, except that the packed-refs file is opened and closed before its file attributes are considered. An open/close of the packed-refs file is known to refresh its file attributes, at least on some NFS clients. If `unset`, JGit will use the behavior described in `trustFolderStat`. Note: since 6.10.2, this setting applies during both ref reads and writes, but previously only applied during reads.|\n```",
