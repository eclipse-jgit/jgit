If it is not, then it\u0027s probably better to figure out why.\n\nLine 276 gets ANDed with 277, this line does not, perhaps that ANDing should be happening, and this is broken and giving false positives (is there a negative test,if not this change should have one?)?",

Perhaps these 2 should be OR\u0027ed in line 275 as in the current code it is checked if the object is in alt space but not loaded or alternatively checked if it is not there and tried to load... or I\u0027m messing it up ðŸ˜Š",
