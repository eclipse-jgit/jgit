      "message": "This no longer holds true now that jgit can read linked worktrees\n\nThe `workTree \u003d\u003d null` check used to work as an approximation for determining whether a repo was bare, but that no longer holds true with linked worktrees. A bare repo can have many linked worktrees and when a jgit Repository is instantiated with the path of a linked worktree, the `worktree field will be set to the path of the linked worktree, but that doesn\u0027t make the repo a non-bare repo`",
