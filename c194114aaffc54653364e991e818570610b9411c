I\u0027m leaning towards having a policy switch in RefDirectory to refresh loose ref dirs (off by default), something like `trustLooseRefStat.AFTER_OPEN`, and then in a follow-up change, add the functionality for SnapshottingRefDirectory to remember which loose ref dirs have been refreshed and not refresh them again unless the snapshot becomes invalid.",
