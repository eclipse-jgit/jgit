      "message": "I am trying to understand that return type and how does it represent cartesian product of N sets.\n\nBy definition [1], cartesian product of two sets A and B is a set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is from A and b is from B:\n\n  A x B \u003d {(a,b) | a from A, B from B}\n  \nFor N sets A1, A2, AN, cartesian product is set of all n-tuples (a1, a2, ... an) where each a1 is from A1, a2 is from A2, ....\n\n  A1 x A2 x ... x An \u003d {(a1, a2, ..., an) | a1 from A1, a2 from A2, ...}\n\nHow does this return type represent a set of n-tuples? The outer Set\u003c...\u003e is OK because cartesian product is a Set. But it is not set of sets but set of tuples\nand a tuple cannot be represented by a Set because order is needed. Using a List to represent tuple would be one possibility, that\u0027s what Guava also does [2]. So the return type should be:\n\n  Set\u003cList\u003c?\u003e\u003e\n\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product#n-ary_Cartesian_product\n[2] https://guava.dev/releases/22.0/api/docs/com/google/common/collect/Sets.html#cartesianProduct-java.util.List-",
