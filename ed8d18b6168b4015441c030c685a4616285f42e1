This makes e.g. blame computations extremely slow, due to the blame matrices that are being computed (I assume, for rename detection).\n\nMy proposal is simple and can probably be improved easily: try to find a rename match for files with the same file name or in the same folder as the added file.\n\nThomas Wolf suggested I coordinate the change with you, as you maybe have something better planned.\n\nBest regards,\nSimeon",
