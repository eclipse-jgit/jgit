It should not take longer to process a very simple file than it does to read the data from NFS, if it does, it signals that something in the code is problematic.\n\nYes, exactly. I was also shocked when I saw that reading a 30M file from a local high-perf SSD was taking *hundreds of millisecs* !!!\n\n\u003e Can you figure out what is taking so long? Is it calculating the sha1 (something that it seems like we should not need to do)?\n\nIt\u0027s both, but I can measure how much they contributed to the overall 90% bottleneck.\n\n\u003e I suspect that we don\u0027t actually want to waste memory storing the contents of a file twice as this change does, as this does not scale well for bigger files.\n\nWell, we already waste a lot of space because the caching logic of packed-refs isn\u0027t very advanced: we store the *whole* content in memory in millions of Java objects, which is bad. I agree we should look at options to save memory regardless, any idea?",
