      "message": "This bug is a sign of a missing test somewhere. Looking for an non-existing oid (bigger/smaller/in-the-middle than anything else) should be well covered.\n\nThis class doesn\u0027t need real data. We could write a pair of hardcoded oidFanout/oidLookup to test this.\n\nI think just an oidFanout with all 0 and an empty oidLookup should already trigger this bug.\n\nOr oidFanout with [1, 2, 2, ...] and oidLookup [\"000000..01\", \"0100000...01\"] and then asking for \"ff000000...00\" ?",
