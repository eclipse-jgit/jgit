      "message": "The new package needs to the exported in MANIFEST.MF. You need to decide what constitutes public API (if anything). If there is no public API, the package should be org.eclipse.jgit.internal.signing, and it is to be exported as x-internal\u003dtrue. Otherwise export the package publicly, but ensure only the public API is actually accessible. (Make everything else package-visible only, for instance. Or move it to an \"...internal.signing\" package that is exported only as x-internal.) Public API needs to have \"@since 7.6.0\" annotations in javadoc. I presume public API would be at most the two factory classes.\n\nThe message texts can go into the normal JGitText.",

      "message": "Desired outcome is\n\n1. no warning\n2. well-defined signer factory being used\n\nLet\u0027s see... if a user includes o.e.j.gpg.bc in the application, it is highly likely that he wants to use that. If he includes some other (proprietary) bundle that publishes a `SignerFactory`, it is extremely likely that he wants to use that implementation. If the application includes multiple bundles publishing `SignerFactory` services such that the service locator picks them up, then a warning _is_ wanted (since it is undefined which one will be picked up first and used).\n\nSo I would go for:\n* don\u0027t publish the new factories introduced here as services\n* in `Signers.loadSigners()`, set the new factory defined here only if no service could be found for the format\n\nWith that, we\u0027d use the new factories as default if no service was found. If a user then still wants to use some other factory, his code can call `Signers.set(...)` to define it explicitly. Leave the factories public so that user code can explicitly do `Signers.set(GpgFormat.OPENPGP, new GpgBinarySignerFactory());`. (And as mentioned, anything else but the two factories probably doesn\u0027t need to be public API.)",
