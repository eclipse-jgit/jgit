      "message": "The code looks good to me.\n\n\nUnrelated to this change: I cannot find any code that would validate the received PushCertificate. Shouldn\u0027t we verify the certificate\u0027s signature somewhere? Interestingly the C git documentation doesn\u0027t say what to do if the certificate doesn\u0027t pan out. Do they leave all that to the pre-receive hook? Would have to check what they actually do in source code :-(. They do say that they verify the certificate signature with GPG and pass on the certificate and the GPG result via environment variables to the pre-receive hook.\n\n\nAlso unrelated to this change: JGit doesn\u0027t seem to support SSH certificates as push certificates yet. Does C git? The documentation says \"the certificate is verified using GPG\"... really? Might be a documentation error; again one would have to dig into the C git sources to be sure.",
