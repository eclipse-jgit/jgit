      "message": "I believe the breakage is caused by these lines in GC.java:\n```\n\t\tfor (Pack p : repo.getObjectDatabase().getPacks()) {\n\t\t\tcheckCancelled();\n\t\t\tif (p.shouldBeKept())\n\t\t\t\texcluded.add(p.getIndex());\n\t\t}\n```\n\nThe keep files are to be completely ignored from the list of packfiles, because:\n- They are intermediate files: they may be never completed or committed\n- We are unsure of how their commits will be linked to refs: how do we know where they should go?\n\nHowever, the keep files may also contain commits that already exists in the repository, because there is no negotiation during `git push`.\n\nExcluding the objects pointed by the packfiles with a keep file associated isn\u0027t exactly the same thing as excluding the packfile altogether.\n\nLet me try a fix to this problem with a follow-up change.",
