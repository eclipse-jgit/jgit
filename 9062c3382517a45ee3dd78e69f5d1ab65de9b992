      "message": "We can but we do not it in RevCommit. Also all valid usages that calls setParent isn\u0027t actually overriding parents but are real parents. Hence we cannot be sure if parent been set on RevCommit is real parent or an overridden parent. \nSo my approach here was all RevCommit\u0027s are non overridden and any subclass that extends RevCommit makes its parents overrideable.\n\nAnother approach is to always return false here and have impl return true. This will also not rely on setParents though.",
