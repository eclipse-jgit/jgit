      "message": "It\u0027s a little nit picky, but this would be a performance problem if the number of packs (and steps in the chain) was really high, since at each level of recursion you\u0027re allocating a list for the entire chain. It ends up quadratic.\n\nI think it\u0027s simple enough to just iterate over the chain without recursing that it\u0027s worth fixing, even if unlikely to be a problem in practice.",
