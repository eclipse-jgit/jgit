      "message": "Why does simply compiling with Java 17 with option \"--release 11\" not work? Why do we have to compile with Java 11?\n\nIn the CI-build, we\u0027d have to request to use a Java 17 explicitly. (The default on the centos-7 images is Java 11.) That could be done in the Jenkinsfile; something like\n\n  tools {\n    jdk : \u0027temurin-jdk17-latest\u0027\n  }\n  \nshould do the trick. The contributor\u0027s guide should be updated and state that one needs Java 17 to build JGit (and EGit).\n\nIf you want to run the tests on a Java 11 JVM, then yes, there should be a toolchain with at least an entry for JavaSE-11. We\u0027ve used toolchains in the EGit build because for a while we compiled with Java 11 but had a BREE of Java 8, and I wanted the tests to run on Java 8 back then.",
