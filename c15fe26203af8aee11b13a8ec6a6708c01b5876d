I feel a responsibility to leave the lines of code in a state that I could understand again and explain to another person (without the three days of head-scratching that it took last time).\n\nWhere\u0027s the documentation / guidelines that say the in-line comments are a no-no? I was trying to avoid any functional changes and the 11 in-line comments added have a benefit of being exactly above each confusing code line.\n\nHow about the patch I will upload now (#20), that separates this long sorting logic into three methods, to provide a better location for explanations (in the methods\u0027 javadocs)?",
