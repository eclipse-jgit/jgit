      "message": "An alternative design that I was drafting in the DFS side. I am not sure it is better than this, just bouncing the idea:\n\nWhat about creating a \"MultiPack\", a composite that looks like a single pack and internally has n-packs glued together by the multipack index.\n\nThen we tweak the PackList. When creating the packlist, if there is multipack index, we replace the packs in the midx with a single MultiPack. For example, the stack [pack1,pack2,pack3], with a multipack index over pack1,pack2, would become: [MultiPack(pack1, pack2), pack3].\n\nThen all the code that does \"for (Pack pack: packList) { ... pack.something() }\" would benefit from the multipack index.\n\nDunno, there is more inheritance and complexity. But I think this idea would also work cleanly with multiple midx and would support cleanly midx bitmaps. What do you think?",
