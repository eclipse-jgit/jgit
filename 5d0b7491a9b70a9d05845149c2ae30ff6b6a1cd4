Last thing we want is to break all unshallows that have been working well so far.\n\nAny chance to keep this as a patch downstream until proved?\n\nA strong precondition to touch anything in un/shallowing is to cover it with reasonable tests (eg unshallowing in linear history, on a merge, just before a merge...).",

For example, what happens with unshallow requests when \"thin\" is true? will the commits in the boundary be included?\n\nCorrect, and the `thin` never worked for the `unshallow` requests because the BoundaryGenerator was never adapted to support the `unshallow` requests.\nIt isn\u0027t technically a regression, because it never worked.",
