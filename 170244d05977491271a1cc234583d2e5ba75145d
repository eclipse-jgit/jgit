      "message": "The bottleneck is on our end, I spent quite some time organizing the migration to gerrithub and need to finish releasing 6.8. Didn\u0027t hear from Thomas for a while, I guess he is busy with something else.\n\nQuestion is what to do with the other branches when this gets submitted ? I guess nobody has the time to adapt this fix to all the different branches between 5.13 and master. We could merge stable-5.13 to stable-6.0 and remove the fix in this merge to avoid we have to do this work. This would mean the fix is only available in 5.13 and from 6.6.1 upwards.",

I appreciate your reply.\n\nMaking this available in 5.13 and from 6.6.1 upwards sounds a reasonable plan to me. \n\nWe unfortunately can\u0027t upgrade to JGit 6 because we can\u0027t drop Java 8.
