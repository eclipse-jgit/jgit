How does this saves any pulling from the source? In any case it will need to do source.next() until the parent \"deeper\" in the generator.\n\nUsing pN for parents and cN for other commits:\n\nIf the parents are [p1, p2, p3] and the queue [c1, p2, c2, p3, p1, ...]\nthis does source.next() 5 times (for p1), and p2 and p3 will be already parsed.\n\nSame parents, if the queue is [o1, p1, p2, o2, p3,...], this does source.next() also 5 times (2 for p1 + 1 for p2 + 2 for p3).",
