      "message": "Yes, there is no special handling for symbolic refs here. But with this change, JGit will **always** do a **single** full ref scan, no matter if the `ref-prefix` had only one symbolic (or non-symbolic) ref or 53 filters for different types of refs.\n\nAdditionally, in my investigation, I\u0027ve never seen a git client sending only a single `ref-prefix HEAD`. It always included other `ref-prefix`es like `refs/HEAD` or `refs/heads/HEAD` or `refs/tags/`.",

      "message": "I\u0027m not familiar with the code paths that lead to this method, but wouldn\u0027t this potentially perform much worse than before if a prefix representing a low % of total refs is given? i.e. if you have 5 tags and 300k other refs and you give the prefix `refs/tags/`, now you need to get 300k+5 refs instead of only 5. Am I missing something for why that wouldn\u0027t be the case?",
