      "message": "Sorry for the hassle. This was blocking the import of JGit into our systems. The plugin test looks reasonable and chromium cared enough to write a test. I don\u0027t know how important is that case for them, but I wouldn\u0027t risk a regression for a new feature that can wait a bit.\n\nI reported this to the author and he is ok with the revert. In https://eclipse.gerrithub.io/c/eclipse-jgit/jgit/+/1172926, I copy the test into FooterLineTest hoping it helps to get this work in.\n\nIf this revert is causing problems somewhere else, we can reapply the change and I can patch it internally.",
