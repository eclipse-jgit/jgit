      "message": "Move the description of the problem before the technical details. \n\nIf I understant correctly:\n```\nIn an unshallow fetch, shallow commits reachable multiple times are not emitted during the walk.\n\nWith a topology like this:\n\nA --- B --- C \u003c-[master]\n        \\\n          --- D \u003c- [v0.14.1]\n          \na client with B shallow gets this error from doing `git fetch --unshallow`:\n\nerror: Could not read (SHA1 of A)\nfatal: Failed to traverse parents of commit (SHA1 of B)\n```\n\nIf so, this should be the test!\n\nIf D doesn\u0027t exist and it is a single line history, unshallow works fine? \n\nwhat if B is not shallow, but A is? would the fetch work fine?",

      "message": "Do you mean that, to solve the unshallow, the walk combines the depth+toposort+boundary generators. The depth generator does the right thing, but topo and boundary mess it up? Can you be more concrete?\n\ntoposort doesn\u0027t seem to check the UNSHALLOW flag, so I don\u0027t see why it should skip that commit.",
