      "message": "the term \"changedPathFilter\" is a contextual term on the revCommit level, Commit Graph field naming should not be determined by how the invokers want to use the data. This class is only meant to be a data container in memory holding bloom filters, so please just call it GraphBloomFilterData; technically, the bloom filters don\u0027t have to be used to exclusively store changed path either, so forcing the name of \"changedPathFilter\" isn\u0027t ideal on this level of abstraction. \n\nrecommendation: change class name to GraphBloomFilterData.",
