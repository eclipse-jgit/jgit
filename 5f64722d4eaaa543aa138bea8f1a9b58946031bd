While we could skip some work if we keep the optimization, what we would skip in that no-op case is:\n\n FileSnapshot.save(directory) // gets lastModifiedTime for `directory`\n getPackFilesByExtById() // walks the files in the objects/pack/ directory and populates a map\n oldPack.getFileSnapshot().isModified(packFile) // gets lastModifiedTime for `packFile`\n\nI think it\u0027s safe to assume the file snapshot methods are fast on any filesystem where you would be trusting that stat, and at least one of those is equivalent to the check I\u0027m removing, so worst case it\u0027s net +1 stat call.
