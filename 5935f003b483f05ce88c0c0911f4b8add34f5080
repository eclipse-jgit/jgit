      "message": "Apparently Java 17\u0027s doclint wants private methods to be also documented which we don\u0027t want to enforce. Switching this off using \"-Xdoclint:all,-missing/private\" fails with the error: \"error: Access qualifiers not permitted for -Xdoclint arguments\" which seems odd since javac says this is supported:\n\n```\n$ javac -X\n...\n  -Xdoclint\n        Enable recommended checks for problems in javadoc comments\n  -Xdoclint:(all|none|[-]\u003cgroup\u003e)[/\u003caccess\u003e]\n        Enable or disable specific checks for problems in javadoc comments,\n        where \u003cgroup\u003e is one of accessibility, html, missing, reference, or syntax,\n        and \u003caccess\u003e is one of public, protected, package, or private.\n  -Xdoclint/package:[-]\u003cpackages\u003e(,[-]\u003cpackage\u003e)*\n        Enable or disable checks in specific packages.
