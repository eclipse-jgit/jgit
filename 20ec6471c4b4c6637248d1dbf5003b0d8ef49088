Dave B had a POC [1] and Martin provided a version [2] that we used in production for several years.\n\nHow does the improvement in this change compare to what would be provided by [2]? Martin\u0027s testing had shown a PriorityQueue wasn\u0027t as performant as his alternate solution.\n\n[1] 5491: Proof-of-concept PriorityQueue implementation of DateRevQueue | https://review.gerrithub.io/c/eclipse-jgit/jgit/+/5491\n[2] 24295: RFC: BucketQueue (LinearMinFinder) | https://review.gerrithub.io/c/eclipse-jgit/jgit/+/24295",

It seems it was abandoned because it was slower in some use cases.\n\nthere\u0027s also another benchmark in I892de0d599cdc9f0773c2293c83a0905b85d8a8a\n\nwe could move [2] to another class and run the benchmarks with all 3 implementations to compare them",
