      "message": "I have two stack traces showing over 300 threads in removeAll() using a war from the tip of stable-6.10 without this change in it. That means that unfortunately the removeAll() alone does not result in the proper timing to consolidate enough of these removals to improve the performance.",

      "message": "We deployed this last night and had an incident with around 700 packfiles being deleted by gc this afternoon and I could not see any sign in the jstacks (running every 5 seconds) that this code was even running; it seems to have very gracefully handled the removals almost instantly. We still had some http thread spikes, but from the jstack, I believe these are now due to the new packfiles being loaded (which is good), as opposed to removing the old deleted packfiles. Friday tends to be a bit slower, so hopefully this will also stand up to the load early next week, I will monitor more.\n\nI think there is still room for improvement with respect to gc performance, particularly on the loads in Pack.java which is littered with full file synchronizeds and some synchronized(readLock)s (some of those inside the full file ones even). These show up in the jstacks. It looks like loading the bitmaps basically blocks everything, we may want to improve that further.",

      "message": "It turns out we deployed an earlier version, PS3, of this change last Friday by accident. Since PS3 is buggy and can get stuck in a state then never removes files, it explains what I was seeing, a cache which only evicted things when it was full.\n\nWe deployed PS7 this morning and I am delighted that it seems very fast indeed, and the cache appears to get cleared properly. I cannot catch it doing any removal work in any jstacks, despite running them a second apart. Any remaining slowness is now clearly on the loading side of things, no longer on evicting. I will keep monitoring this and I will post any issues we might see.",
