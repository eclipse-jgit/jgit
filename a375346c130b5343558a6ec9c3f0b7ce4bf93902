      "message": "* removes the \"Gpg\" prefix from the signing interfaces\n* makes them future-proof (should not need changes when CMS or SSH signatures are implemented)\n* uses the same ServiceLoader mechanism for both signers and verifiers\n\nA new signer or verifier would mean\n* writing the new Signer of SignatureVerifier\n* writing a new factory\n* publishing the factory via the ServiceLoader\u0027s service mechanism\n\nI did not rename the gpg.bc bundle; bundle renaming is always a hassle ith getting updates right. I also did not rename class GpgSignature because it would touch further interfaces, like ObjectBuilder. We could do so... I do wonder about the reason for this GpgSignature class, though; a plain byte[] would work just as well.\n\nI\u0027ve adapted EGit to these interfaces, and everything still works, and in places looks neater.",
