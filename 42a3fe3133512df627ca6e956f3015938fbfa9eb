Having it under gc does not tie up the dependency between commit graph and bloomFilters and provides a false assumption. Given as of now there is no writeChangePaths flag in c-git yet this isn\u0027t a compatibility issue either. I want to change this soon before a release is made out after which it would be almost impossible to update this.",
