And if ti is not updates parents the old fashion way.\n\nAlso we only transform RevCommits not anyone that is a special subclass of RevCommit.\n\nPrevious failure was due to EGit\u0027s KidCommit that extendeds from RevCommit and was being passed in to the RewriteGenerator. This change now makes sure that we only update parents for RevCommits.",
