I\u0027m thinking of RevWalk in the later patchset https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/183079/40/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/RevWalk.java.\n\nHaving the ObjectReader providing the commitGraph gives the impression that pack data and commit graph are collocated, which might be the case for Dfs.\n\nThanks!",

If it is \"public RevWalk(Repository repo)\", then we can get ObjectDataBase, but if it is “public RevWalk(ObjectReader or)”, it will not work. So I think this patch should still be necessary.\n\nIn my opinion, ObjectReader#getCommitGraph() is very similar to ObjectReader#getBitmapIndex().",
