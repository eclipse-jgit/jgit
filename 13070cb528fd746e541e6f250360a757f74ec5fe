Isn\u0027t rewriting parents a concern of the generator (or RevWalk), not of the filters (which filter by either commits or trees)?",

RevWalk creates StartGenerator which delegates to RewriteGenerator based on the flag state. \n\n3. The rewrite flag already existed on the TreeRevFilter and I am honoring that. This is the only reason I am exposing isRewriteEnabled on RevFilter. Given And/Or Filter also nestles TreeRevFilter we need it there as well. Its cleaner to have it on the RevFilter.",
