That could lead to similar issues if we do.\n\nIt was almost two months ago, but from what I remember I did look for similar cases in this code area and haven\u0027t found anything. We should also examine FNFE handling on a case-by-case basis and not bundle multiple fixes into a single change. HTH.\n\nI\u0027ll also address typos pointed out on the git.eclipse instance.",
