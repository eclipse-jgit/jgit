      "message": "Andrey, merging is fine. Shortly before a release we hava a \"limbo\" state in which both master and stable-6.2 produce 6.2 artifacts. They thus publish to the same location. During that time, EGit may pick up whatever was built last, which may be master or stable-6.2. If you add new API in that phase, you get the problems you saw. Either merging master to stable-6.2 or just retriggering the latest master build resolves the problem.\n\nSoon Matthias will switch master to produce 6.3 artifacts, and from then on you\u0027ll have to explicitly cherry-pick to stable-6.2 (or push to stable-6.2 and then merge to master) anything you still want in 6.2.",

      "message": "Thomas, I don\u0027t understand what is missing now.\n\nThe jgit is merged, but p2 repo still has old build.\n\nThe egit gerrit uses https://repo.eclipse.org/content/unzip/snapshots.unzip/org/eclipse/jgit/org.eclipse.jgit.repository/6.2.0-SNAPSHOT/ and there required commits still aren\u0027t there.\n\nDo one need to trigger some deployment job manually? Or is that scheduled once per day? \n\nI would like to see tests in egit gerrit green for https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/egit/egit/+/158679, so we could merge the missing bits for external diff on egit side.",
