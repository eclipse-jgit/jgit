Or is this too late?\n\nI mean this (and predecessors in master) https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/166943 are needed for this (with predecessors) in egit: https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/egit/egit/+/158679/",

      "message": "Andrey, merging is fine. Shortly before a release we hava a \"limbo\" state in which both master and stable-6.2 produce 6.2 artifacts. They thus publish to the same location. During that time, EGit may pick up whatever was built last, which may be master or stable-6.2. If you add new API in that phase, you get the problems you saw. Either merging master to stable-6.2 or just retriggering the latest master build resolves the problem.\n\nSoon Matthias will switch master to produce 6.3 artifacts, and from then on you\u0027ll have to explicitly cherry-pick to stable-6.2 (or push to stable-6.2 and then merge to master) anything you still want in 6.2.",
