CPU because of those additional objects needs to be \"traversed\" while creating bitmap and pack file.\n\nDo you think it would make sense to document this _somewhere_?",

The duplication is minimal and the difference would be negligible anyway.\n\nC-Git doesn\u0027t document the feature mentioning any memory overload, I\u0027ve just copy\u0026pasted the C-Git documentation and I\u0027d prefer to keep it consistent with it.",
